## How to make an excpetion/exclusion?

Click on windows key and search for Virus & threat Protection. Go click the manage settings. Then scroll all the way down to exclusions and click “ add exclusion” if it is a folder that you want to exclude, click the folder option. For another antivirus pls search it on google make sure to have one with excluded folder (mcaffee don't have it just saying)

### Is this a virus

NO

### I saw on my antivirus this threat?

It's a false positive because it moves some memory parts and the tools are not signed

### I made an exception but it still doesn't work?

because your files are still blocked by the previous scan, make sure you have the folder exception on everthing that has to do with old siege (including downloader/tools) and replace everthing (don't delete just replace aka redownload (tools/downloader)
