## Can I trust this?

files are from official steam servers that store files (for i. of every siege version), thats why this download tool needs login details, coz it needs to access that database of files, and bc siege is paid, downloader and steam servers needs account to validate ownership and download game files !! WE DON'T FORCE ANYONE TO DOWNLOAD THIS !!

## WE DON'T FORCE ANYONE TO DOWNLOAD THIS
{% endhint %}

If someone is forcing you to download something that means it's a high chance of malware

## Is it safe to enter my password?

Yes, you can view the source code for [Depot Downloader](https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader)

## How do I verify my game files and what is the meaning of verify

Run the downloader again, it will skip files you already have downloaded (make sure to add an exclusion) aka run the downloader without deleting it.\
\
The meaning of verify is that it checks the files for corruption. If one of the file is corrupt it will repair them that is why you never delete the game if it doesn't work.

## Why am i getting "Encountered unexpected error downloading chunk xxxxxxxxxxxx: The operation was canceled." errors?

Its normal ignore them. Wait, if downloader said done , restart and select the same season

## How do I download to another drive?

Select the folder with your downloader snip it aka ctrl+x and then paste it to your destination ctrl+v
